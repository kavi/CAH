# Making a new Game

A new Game is made by a logged in User. This user becomes the 'owner' of the game.

When the game is made it is 'active' but not 'started'. This means that other
User's can join the game.

When a User joins a game he becomes a Player associated to the game.

Once the Game is started new Players can no longer join.

## Nice to have

It would be nice to either send invites to players when you make a new game, or set a password required to join the game.

It would also be nice to allow players to join the game after it has started.


# Starting the Game

In a game that is active but not started the following operations are allowed:

 - the Game can be started by the owner (this causes the state to change to 'Started')
 - the Owner can 'kick' players from the Game - that is they are no longer part of the Game.


# Playing the Game

A game that is active and started is a Game that is currently being played.

From here the Game is played in 'rounds' consisting of the following phases:

 - Draw Black Card
 - Draw Player Hands (White Card)
 - Play White Cards (Player action)
 - Vote (Player action)
 - Cleanup

## Draw Black Card

This phase happens automatically at the beginning of the round. A new Black
Card is drawn from the Black Card deck and becomes the active Black Card this
round.

## Draw Player Hands

This phase is also automatic. Player hands are refreshed with cards from the
White Deck up till the have a full hand. The size of a full hand is $7 +
cardsToDraw$ from the active Black Card.

## Play White Cards

In this round players must play an amount of white cards equal to
activeBlackCard.cardsToPick. Once a player has played his card(s) he can
perform no other actions during this phase.

Once all players have played their cards the Game proceeds to the next phase.


## Vote

In this round each player must Vote for the Player he thought played the best
White Card(s) for the question. A player can not vote on himself. A player
must vote on exactly one other player.

Once all players have placed a vote the Game proceeds to the next phase.

## Cleanup

The last phase of a round is cleanup. Played cards are now moved to the "White
Card Discard" pile. The active Black Card is moved to the Black Card Discard
pile.

The player that received the most Votes gets 1 point. In case of a tie all players
with the most votes get 1 point.


# Actions

When in a Game (an active+started Game must be selected for these actions to make sense)
a Player can make the following actions.

 - Play White Card(s) (Only in Play White Cards phase, and if he hasn't played
   cards yet. The Play White Card action must be performed with the amount of cards
   expected by the active Black Card (cardsToPick).

 - Vote (Only in Vote phase. A player may vote for exactly one other players played cards. 
   Cannot be performed if the Player has already voted)

 - View Hand (Can be performed at any time)

 - View active Black Card (Can be performed at any time)

 - Discard cards (Can be performed in the Vote phase at the cost of 1 point.
   Cannot be performed by players with < 1 point). Any number of cards can be
   discarded per action (no extra cost).

 - View score (Any time)

 - View played cards (Only in the Vote phase)
   - the player cannot see who played a card until after he has placed his vote.
   - a player can always see which card he played.
